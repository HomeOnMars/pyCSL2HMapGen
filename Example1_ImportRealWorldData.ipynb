    "## How to: import real-world height map for Cities: Skylines 2 Map Editor (beta)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Before we start, have you checked out the amazing guides on discord?  \n",
    "Because I certainly didn't, which means that this guide could be potentially out of date...\n",
    "\n",
    "Just visit https://terraining.ateliernonta.com/ and use their website's tool to download the height map.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. prefer not to signing up for mapbox (required for the above website's tool), and\n",
    "2. know how to use `python`,\n",
    "\n",
    "then you can use my code to do more-or-less the same,\n",
    "by following the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0: Install python\n",
    "Use pip or Anaconda (or whatever) to install the required dependencies:\n",
    "    `python` (>=3.10), `numba, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pypng, gdal, cudatoolkit`\n",
    "before you continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Find a real world location you want to make your CSL2 map out of.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use many existing online tools, such as https://heightmap.skydark.pl/beta or https://terraining.ateliernonta.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you grab 3 pieces of info:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the longtitude (of the center of the map),\n",
    "2. the latitude (same), and\n",
    "3. the scale (1.0 means to scale 57kmx57km, while 2.0 means 1:2, i.e. mapping 115kmx115km real-world to 57kmx57km in-game.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Download the height map data.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. from JAXA's ALOS Global Digital Surface Model ( https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/aw3d30/aw3d30_e.htm )\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from other sources should work too, but I haven't tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to grab the data that covers the area you are interested in.\n",
    "If you download data from JAXA, you will need to register for their website,\n",
    "**and supply them your name, company, email address** etc. personal information.\n",
    "(At least they don't ask for your credit card number, unlike mapbox :-/ )\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to read their *terms of service* too.\n",
    "Their data are free-to-use but **you need to acknowledge your use of their data** - \n",
    "see their ToS for the exact wording requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Download & set the parameters of the script here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git clone` or whatever method to download this package.\n",
    "(See the green `code` button in the up-right corner of the previous webpage.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure python & the dependencies are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put the map data into the raw folder inside the script folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open this jupyter notebook file (`Example1_*.ipynb`) if you have jupyter notebook,\n",
    "edit the last few lines under the section \"# Example\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the list `tiffilenames` to be a list of the filenames of *your* datafiles. The script will only use the data listed there.\n",
    "2. Change the parameters (from Step 1) for the function `get_CSL_height_maps()`:\n",
    "    `long` for center longtitude,\n",
    "    `lati` for center latitude,\n",
    "    `scale` for the scale.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Feel free to explore other parameters of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Run the script\n",
    "\n",
    "This should produce 2 files: `worldmap_{cityname}.png` and `playable_{cityname}.png` in the `out/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "(cityname by default is the longtitude, latitude, rotational angle, and scale.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the heightmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Import them in-game\n",
    "\n",
    "Put those 2 files in your CSL2 saves folder `...\\Cities Skylines II\\Heightmaps\\`\n",
    "\n",
    "Boot up the game, enter the editor (beta), in the terrain section of the editor,\n",
    "- select `import height map` and import the `playable` png file;\n",
    "- select `import world map`  and import the `worldmap` png file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are good to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Enjoy map-building and celebrate!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to add the acknowledgement for JAXA if you do publish anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "Would be kind to acknowledge me too- but don't feel pressured.\n"
